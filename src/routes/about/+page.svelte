  <div class="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert mt-8 max-w-none">
    <p class="text-xl text-muted-foreground">
      I'm an enthusiastic developer with a passion for creating web applications
      and exploring new technologies. I'm also an avid collector and player of
      board games!

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Background</h2>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground">
        I have an undergraduate degree in Physics from James Madison University
        and a Master of Science in Applied Urban Science and Informatics from
        CUSP @ NYU.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground pt-2">
        I picked up my love for programming during my time as an undergraduate
        research assistant at JMU, where I used <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)">IDL</a
        > to analyze images of bubbles. After that experience, I decided to take
        a creative web development class while working on my Master's degree, and
        I've been hooked ever since!
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground pt-2">
        After graduating, I started work as a consultant and software engineer
        at Booz Allen Hamilton, where I honed my front-end development skills.
        Since then, I've worked on a variety of projects, from building tools
        for government clients to working on applications for financial
        institutions.

      <p class="text-muted-foreground">
        I am well versed in web development, having worked with the original
        AngularJS, Angular, and Svelte, not to mention Vanilla Javascript and
        HTML/CSS. I also have experience with Python for data analysis and
        visualization. I enjoy learning about new frameworks and libraries, and
        I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.

      <p class="text-muted-foreground pt-2">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me playing or looking for new board
        games to play. I love the social aspect of board games and the strategic
        thinking they require. My favorite games include <a
